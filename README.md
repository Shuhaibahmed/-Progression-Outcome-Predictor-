<p>As part of my Software Development 1 coursework at the University of Westminster, I created a Python program to predict student progression outcomes at the end of each academic year.</p>

<h5>Key Features of the Program:</h5>

• User Input: Prompts users to input credits for pass, defer, and fail.
• Conditional Logic: Uses efficient conditional statements for accurate results.
• Multiple Predictions: Supports predictions for multiple students in a loop.
• Data Visualization: Generates a histogram for distribution of progression outcomes.
• Data Persistence: Saves inputted data to a text file for future reference.
• Leverages user-defined functions and descriptive variable and function names.
