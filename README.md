<p>As part of my Software Development 1 coursework at the University of Westminster, I created a Python program to predict student progression outcomes at the end of each academic year.</p>

<h5>Key Features of the Program:</h5>
<br>
• User Input: Prompts users to input credits for pass, defer, and fail.<br>
• Conditional Logic: Uses efficient conditional statements for accurate results.<br>
• Multiple Predictions: Supports predictions for multiple students in a loop.<br>
• Data Visualization: Generates a histogram for distribution of progression outcomes.<br>
• Data Persistence: Saves inputted data to a text file for future reference.<br>
• Leverages user-defined functions and descriptive variable and function names.
<br><br>Skills: Python (Programming Language)
